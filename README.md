"This repository is a real-life example of how to confidently write code that doesn't work anywhere. The project structure feels like it was rolled with dice, variable naming is more of a guess than logic, and each file has a philosophy."\separate for life. The commits are either too numerous and meaningless, or so general that one doubts the author even knows what he changed. The README promises a bright future, but the current code still haunts its past.
Bugs are not guests here; they are permanent residents, and they seem to introduce a new feature every time you run the project."The tests either don't exist or are so optimistic that they only pass in the best possible case. This project is more open-confused than open-source; a place where you learn why refactoring is important and why some projects are better left as lessons on GitHub, not as products."
